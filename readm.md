# Algorithms And Data-Structures.
- Searching Algorithms
  - Linear Search algorithm
  - Binary Search algorithm
- Sorting Algorithms
  - Selection Sort algorithm
  - Quick Sort algorithm

# Big-O:
- Searching Algorithms:
  - O(n) => Linear Search
  - O(log n) => Binary Search
- Sorting Algorithms:
  - O(n^2) => Selection Sort
  - O(n * log n) => in the average case on Quick Sort, but in the worst case it can perform **O(n^2)** on Quick Sort
